Welcome! In this tutorial I will guide you on the steps required to log in to your account on ieng6.  This task involves 4 simple steps, and only requires a computer, access to the internet, and a web browser.

#### Without further ado, let's begin!

## Step 1: Finding your account name

> This account name will be in the format cs15lsp23zz, with "sp23" referring to the term, and "zz" being a placeholder

In order to properly log in to your account, you will first need to know the account name, or username, associated with your account. If you already know this, feel free to move on to the next step.

This account name can be found by navigating to the website located [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). From there, input your student ID username and PID into the corresponding fields, as shown below.

On the same page that we were on before, you will see text near the top of the page that says "Let's set the password for your account."  Beneath that, press the hyperlink. This should direct you to the page shown below.
